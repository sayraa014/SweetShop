# SweetShop

The Sweet Shop Management System is a full-stack web application developed to manage sweets in a shop environment.
It enables an admin user to securely log in and perform basic inventory operations such as:

Adding new sweets

Viewing all available sweets

Deleting sweets

The application is built from scratch using Spring Boot (backend) and React (frontend), following a clean and modular architecture.
The project focuses on fulfilling the required objectives without unnecessary complexity.
Use of AI Tools

AI tools were used responsibly during the development of this project to improve productivity and code quality, while ensuring full understanding and manual control over the final implementation.

How AI Was Used

To generate initial project scaffolding guidance for the backend and frontend.

To assist in designing REST API structures and naming conventions.

To help draft boilerplate code for controllers, services, and React components.

To support debugging errors and understanding framework-specific issues.

To provide guidance on best practices for authentication, API integration, and clean project structure.

Human Contribution

All AI-generated code was reviewed, modified, and integrated manually.

Business logic, validations, and project-specific decisions were implemented and verified by the developer.

The overall architecture, feature selection, and final behavior of the application were determined by the developer.
