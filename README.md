# SweetShop

The Sweet Shop Management System is a full-stack web application developed to manage sweets in a shop environment.
It enables an admin user to securely log in and perform basic inventory operations such as:

Adding new sweets

Viewing all available sweets

Deleting sweets

The application is built from scratch using Spring Boot (backend) and React (frontend), following a clean and modular architecture.
The project focuses on fulfilling the required objectives without unnecessary complexity.
